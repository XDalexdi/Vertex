# Team Problem Statement
**Team Name:** CodeCatalysts  
**Date:** October 10, 2025

## Context
University students use multiple tools (LMS, Google Calendar, Notion, etc.) to manage tasks. This causes confusion and stress, especially during exams, leading to missed deadlines.

## Observed Behavior
- Constantly switching between tools
- Relying on peers for reminders
- Manually copying tasks

## Impact
- Lower grades from missed submissions
- Increased anxiety
- Lost time rechecking multiple platforms

## Target User
Undergraduate students (ages 19–22) managing 5+ courses per semester.

## Core Problem
> Students lack a centralized, automated system to track and visualize academic deadlines, resulting in confusion and stress.

## Evidence
- Most use 3–4 tools daily
- 8/10 have missed or nearly missed a deadline
- Desire automation from LMS

## Success Criteria
1. <5 minutes daily organization time  
2. Automated reminders prevent missed tasks  
3. Unified dashboard view  
4. Smooth mobile & web experience

## Problem Summary
> How might we help students manage academic deadlines from multiple platforms in one unified view?
