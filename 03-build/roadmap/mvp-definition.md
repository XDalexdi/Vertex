## What is our MVP?

Our Minimum Viable Product is an intelligent academic deadline management system that automatically syncs deadlines across university platforms and provides context-aware organization. We focus on solving the core pain point of manual synchronization overhead and tool fragmentation validated across 10+ student interviews.

The MVP delivers a unified dashboard with automated LMS integration, cross-domain task separation, and mobile accessibility - addressing the 2+ hours weekly that students currently waste on manual system management. We prioritize features with the strongest interview evidence and lowest technical complexity to deliver value within our 6-week development timeline.
