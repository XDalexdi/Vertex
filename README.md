# Vertex - Academic Task Management
**Intelligent Deadline Management for University Students**
 
## Project Status
**Current Phase:** Customer Discovery - Interview Analysis  
**Interviews Completed:** 5/10 target  
**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025  
**Next Milestone:** Complete 10 interviews by Week 5 (October 31)
 
## Team Members
- **Aleksandre Dididze** (Team Lead) - CS Undergraduate focus
- **Avtandil Ananidze** (Research Lead) - Business Student focus  
- **Murman Gorgadze** (Technical Lead) - Engineering focus
- **Demetre Mikeladze** (Design Lead) - Graduate Student focus
- **Lekso Potskhverashvili** (Data Lead) - International Student focus
 
## Key Learnings (5 Interviews)
 
### 🎯 Validated Insights
- **Universal Tool Fragmentation:** All students use 3+ disconnected systems daily
- **Significant Time Overhead:** 2-15 hours weekly spent on system management
- **Real Consequences:** Academic penalties, health impacts, and reputation damage
- **Peer Dependency:** Social networks serve as critical safety nets
 
### 🔍 Surprising Discoveries
1. **"System Anxiety":** Constant fear of missing information across platforms
2. **Multi-Domain Complexity:** Graduate students juggle research, teaching, and coursework
3. **High-Stakes Scenarios:** International students face visa risks from academic failures
4. **Custom Solution Burden:** Technical students build tools but become system administrators
 
### 🚨 Critical Pain Points
- **Engineering:** Dependency management and cascade failures in team projects
- **Business:** Reputation damage from coordination failures
- **Graduate:** Impossible choices between research, teaching, and coursework
- **International:** Language barriers and system unfamiliarity creating catastrophic risks
 
## Problem Statement Status
 
### Original Statement
> "Students lack a centralized, automated system to track and visualize academic deadlines, resulting in confusion and stress."
 
### Revised Statement (Based on 5 Interviews)
> "University students across diverse academic contexts lack intelligent systems that understand their specific workflows and provide reliable, context-aware deadline management, leading to unsustainable time investments, chronic stress, and compromised performance across multiple domains."
 
### Decision: **Refined** 🔧
- **Reasoning:** Need for context-awareness and workflow understanding beyond simple centralization
- **Evidence:** Clear patterns across different student types with unique workflow requirements
- **Confidence Level:** High (consistent validation across diverse interviews)
