# Problem Statement Review
**Team:** Vertex
**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Interviews Completed:** 5/10  
**Team Members:** Aleksandre Dididze, Avtandil Ananidze, Murman Gorgadze, Demetre Mikeladze, Lekso Potskhverashvili
 
## Original Problem Statement
> "Students lack a centralized, automated system to track and visualize academic deadlines, resulting in confusion and stress."
 
## Key Findings from Interviews
 
### Strongly Validated Aspects ‚úÖ
 
**1. Tool Fragmentation is Universal**
- All 5 interviewees use 3+ disconnected systems daily
- P001: "I have to check four different apps every morning just to know what I need to do today"
- P002: "Critical deadline changes get lost in WhatsApp, requirements are in LMS, meetings are in Calendar"
 
**2. Significant Time Overhead**
- 2-15 hours weekly spent on system management and manual synchronization
- P001: "Every Sunday I spend two hours copying deadlines from LMS to Google Calendar to Notion"
- P004: Custom script maintenance has become "another part-time job"
 
**3. Emotional & Academic Consequences**
- Stress, anxiety, and actual grade impacts documented across all interviews
- P005: Visa consequences create "constant fear of misunderstanding"
- P003: Physical health impacts including migraines and exhaustion
 
**4. Peer Dependency as Safety Net**
- 100% of interviewees rely on social networks as backup systems
- P002: Reputation damage concerns outweigh grade concerns
 
### Challenged Aspects ‚ùó
 
**1. Centralization Alone is Insufficient**
- Students need context-aware systems, not just consolidated views
- P004: "My calendar showed the time blocks, but not the mental preparation each task required"
 
**2. Visualization is Secondary to Reliability**
- Trust and accuracy matter more than visual features
- P001: "I want automation but don't trust automated systems to be accurate"
 
**3. One-Size-Fits-All Doesn't Work**
- Different student types have fundamentally different needs
- P003 (Engineering) vs P005 (International) vs P004 (Graduate) show distinct workflows
 
**4. Automation Resistance**
- Technical capability exists but social and trust barriers prevent adoption
- P003: "I built a custom dashboard but my teammates won't use it"
 
### Surprising Insights üéØ
 
**1. "System Anxiety" is Real**
- P002: Constant fear of missing information across platforms
- P005: "Constant vigilance" and precautionary behaviors
 
**2. Multi-Domain Complexity**
- Graduate students operate across 3+ professional domains simultaneously
- P004: Research, teaching, and coursework have different stakeholders and consequences
 
**3. High-Stakes Consequences**
- International students face visa termination risks
- Business students prioritize reputation over grades
- Engineering cascade failures affect entire teams
 
**4. Custom Solution Burden**
- Technical students build sophisticated tools but become unpaid system administrators
- P003: "I'm basically the human central database for my team"
 
## Decision on Problem Statement
 
- [ ] Keep original statement
- [x] **Refine statement**  
- [ ] Pivot to new problem
 
### Reasoning & Evidence
 
**Why Refine:**
The core problem of disconnected systems remains valid, but our understanding has deepened significantly. The issue isn't just centralization but **intelligent context-awareness** and **workflow understanding**.
 
**Key Evidence:**
1. **P004 (Graduate):** "No tool understands these aren't comparable tasks" - reveals need for context-aware priority management
2. **P003 (Engineering):** Dependency management requires understanding task relationships, not just deadlines
3. **P005 (International):** Language and cultural barriers create unique workflow requirements
4. **Universal:** Trust issues prevent adoption of even well-designed solutions
 
**Missing from Original:**
- Understanding of different academic contexts and workflows
- Social and trust barriers to tool adoption
- High-stakes consequences beyond academic performance
- Mental preparation and context switching costs
 
## Revised Problem Statement
 
> "University students across diverse academic contexts lack intelligent systems that understand their specific workflows and provide reliable, context-aware deadline management, leading to unsustainable time investments, chronic stress, and compromised performance across multiple domains."
 
### What Changed:
- Added "intelligent systems" and "context-aware" to address workflow understanding
- Emphasized "reliable" to address trust concerns  
- Expanded consequences to include "multiple domains" beyond academics
- Acknowledged diversity of student contexts and needs
 
## Confidence Level & Next Steps
 
### Current Confidence Level: **High** ‚úÖ
 
**Why High Confidence:**
- Consistent patterns across 5 diverse student types
- Emotional validation with specific, concrete examples
- Clear evidence of real academic and personal consequences
- Multiple instances of students building custom solutions (indicating real need)
 
### Open Questions ‚ùì
 
1. **How do non-STEM students manage deadlines differently?**
   - Need P009 (Arts & Humanities) to validate
 
2. **What institutional barriers prevent better systems?**
   - Consider adding faculty interviews
 
3. **How can we build trust in automated systems?**
   - Explore verification and transparency features
 
4. **What makes tools adoptable by resistant teams?**
   - Investigate social dynamics in tool adoption
 
### Next Steps üöÄ
 
**Immediate (This Week):**
1. Complete scheduled interviews 006-010
2. Conduct cross-interview pattern analysis
3. Develop preliminary persona definitions
4. Schedule 2-3 faculty perspectives
 
**Short-term (Week 5):**
1. Reach 10+ interview target
2. Finalize problem statement based on complete data
3. Begin solution ideation workshops
4. Develop prototype concepts for testing
 
**Medium-term (Week 6):**
1. Validate problem statement with additional user types
2. Begin low-fidelity prototyping
3. Develop testing plan for solution concepts
 
### Key Metrics for Validation
- [ ] 10+ completed interviews by Week 5
- [ ] Representation from all major academic disciplines
- [ ] Clear patterns across different student types
- [ ] Specific workflow understanding for each persona
- [ ] Validation of trust and adoption barriers
 
## Interview Strategy Adjustments
 
Based on initial findings, we're adjusting our interview approach:
 
1. **Add faculty perspectives** to understand institutional constraints
2. **Include more Arts/Humanities students** to validate cross-disciplinary patterns  
3. **Explore trust-building features** in future interviews
4. **Investigate social dynamics** in team tool adoption
