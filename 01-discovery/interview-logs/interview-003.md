- **Other relevant info:** Capstone project team lead
 
### Context & Situation
- **Course load:** 4 technical courses + capstone project
- **Group projects:** Capstone (5 members), 2 other group projects
- **Extracurriculars:** Robotics club
- **Relationship to Problem:** Daily management of interdependent deadlines
 
### Current solutions they use:
Google Calendar, physical engineering notebook, LMS, GitHub Projects, WhatsApp.

Extreme – describes "constant triage mode"
 
## Key Quotes (Verbatim)
### Quote 1: Dependency chaos
**What they said (verbatim):**
"When one person's deadline slips, it creates a domino effect that ruins everyone's schedule. We're constantly replanning and it feels like we're building on quicksand."
 
**Context:**
Describing capstone project coordination challenges.
 
**Why it matters:**
Shows critical impact of task dependencies in engineering projects.
 
### Quote 2: Tool resistance
**What they said (verbatim):**
"I built a custom dashboard to track everything, but my teammates won't use it. They say it's too complicated, so I'm stuck being the human central database."
 
**Context:**
Discussing solutions he's tried for team coordination.
 
**Why it matters:**
Highlights the challenge of tool adoption even with custom-built solutions.
 
### Quote 3: Context switching cost
**What they said (verbatim):**
"I lose the first hour of every work session just figuring out what to work on. By the time I'm in flow state, I have to switch to the next urgent thing."
 
**Context:**
Describing daily workflow challenges.
 
**Why it matters:**
Quantifies the productivity loss from poor task management.
 
## Problem Deep Dive
### The Story: What Happened
Giorgi's capstone team hit a major crisis during integration week. The electrical subsystem was delayed due to component shortages, which meant mechanical couldn't complete assembly, which meant software had nothing to test. Despite having a Gantt chart in Excel, no one updated it when the delay occurred.
 
The team discovered the cascade failure three days before the demo. They worked 72 hours straight, skipping all other classes and assignments. Giorgi personally wrote the entire software testing framework in one night, something that should have taken two weeks. They delivered a barely functional prototype and all team members suffered academically in their other courses due to neglected assignments.
 
The stress caused physical health issues - Giorgi developed migraines and one teammate visited the campus clinic for exhaustion. The professor was understanding but noted the poor planning in their evaluation.
 
### Five Whys / Root Cause Exploration
**Surface problem:** Cascade failure due to electrical subsystem delay.
 
**Why #1:** Why wasn't the delay communicated properly?
Their answer: "The electrical lead mentioned it in WhatsApp, but it got buried in other messages."
 
**Why #2:** Why wasn't the project plan updated?
Their answer: "Updating the Gantt chart is manual and time-consuming, so we only do it in formal meetings."
 
**Why #3:** Why don't you have real-time status updates?
Their answer: "We tried GitHub Projects but no one kept their tasks updated consistently."
 
**Why #4:** Why didn't team members update their status?
Their answer: "It feels like extra administrative work when we're already overwhelmed with actual engineering work."
 
**Why #5:** Why are you overwhelmed?
Their answer: "Because we're spending all our time managing the project instead of doing the project."
 
**Root cause assessment:** Engineering teams prioritize technical work over administrative updates, causing planning systems to become outdated and useless.
 
## Emotional Impact
**How did they describe feeling?**
Exhausted, resentful, and like a "project manager instead of an engineer."
 
**What words did they use?**
"Exhausted," "resentful," "burned out," "constant triage."
 
**Physical/behavioural indicators:**
Dark circles under eyes, slumped posture when discussing the incident.
 
**Impact on his life:**
Migraines, strained relationships with teammates, academic performance decline in other courses.
 
## Frequency & Pattern
**How often does this occur?**
Minor dependency issues weekly, major cascade failures 1-2 times per semester.
 
**Is there a pattern?**
Always involves communication breakdown between different engineering disciplines.
 
**Has the frequency changed over time?**
Increased dramatically with capstone project complexity.
 
**Other instances mentioned:**
Similar issues in previous design projects, but with less severe consequences.
 
## Current Solutions & Workarounds
### What They Currently Do
**Primary solution/workaround:** Custom Python dashboard that scrapes multiple APIs and displays dependency graphs.
 
**How they discovered it:** Built it himself after the major failure.
 
**How long they have used it:** 2 months with continuous improvements.
 
### What Works
- Visualizes task dependencies clearly
- Automated data collection from some sources
- Helps him anticipate bottlenecks
 
### What Does Not Work
- Teammates don't use or update it
- Requires manual maintenance of some data sources
- Doesn't prevent others from making changes in other systems
 
### Tools & Resources Used
**Tools/apps/systems:**
- Custom Python dashboard: Primary planning tool
- Google Calendar: Schedule management
- LMS: Course deadlines
- GitHub: Code and issue tracking
- WhatsApp: Team communication
- Excel: Backup planning
 
**Other resources:**
- Weekly team standups (often skipped when busy)
- Physical whiteboard in lab space
 
### Alternatives They Have Tried
- **Microsoft Project:** Too complex for student projects
- **Trello:** Doesn't handle dependencies well
- **Asana:** Team refused to learn another tool
- **Notion:** Good for documentation but poor for task management
 
**Why current approach is "least bad":** Gives him the visibility he needs as team lead, even if others don't use it.
 
## Key Insights & Learnings
### Surprising Findings
Technical students build sophisticated custom solutions but can't overcome team adoption barriers.
 
### Contradictions or Tensions
Wants automated systems but team culture prioritizes "real work" over system maintenance.
 
### Patterns Emerging
Engineering workflows have unique dependency management requirements that generic tools don't address.
 
### Questions Raised
- How can we make status updates frictionless for technical teams?
- What would make engineering students adopt a planning tool?
- How do we handle the unique dependency chains in technical projects?
 
## Confidence Level
☑ Very Confident
 
**Why?** Clear, technical understanding of the problem with specific workflow examples.
 
## Next Steps & Follow-Up
### Referrals Provided
Provided two engineering student contacts from different disciplines.
 
### Future Contact
☑ Participate in future testing
☑ Be contacted for follow-up questions
☑ Review a prototype
☑ Join a beta test
 
**Best way to reach them:** Email or GitHub
 
## Interviewer Notes
**What went well?** Good technical depth and understanding of engineering workflows.
 
**What could be improved?** Should have explored what would make tools adoptable by resistant teammates.
 
**Follow-up actions:**
- Contact engineering student referrals
- Explore dependency management in technical projects
 
## Post-Interview Reflection
**Date logged:** 2025-10-20
**Time to document:** 55 minutes
 
**One-sentence summary:** Engineering students face cascade failures due to poor dependency tracking and team resistance to planning tools, despite building sophisticated custom solutions.
