ICP Match Assessment

The interviewee fits our ICP perfectly: a 21-year-old Business Information Systems student juggling multiple academic tools daily. Their reliance on several unconnected systems makes them ideal for exploring tool fragmentation and cognitive load.

Interviewee Background

Relevant Demographics
Year: Third year
Major: Business Information Systems
Living situation: Off-campus apartment
Work status: Part-time internship (10 hours/week)
Other relevant info: Member of student business club

Context & Situation

Course load: 5 courses including Database Systems and Business Analytics
Group projects: 3 concurrent team projects this semester
Extracurriculars: Business club and part-time internship
Relationship to Problem: Feels overwhelmed by fragmented tools and unclear information sources
Current solutions they use: Trello for project management, Google Calendar for schedules, LMS for deadlines, Telegram for team updates
Pain level: High – reports feeling “constantly tense” and “mentally tired” from managing so many systems

Key Quotes (Verbatim)

Quote 1: Tool overload
What they said (verbatim): “Between LMS, Trello, and Calendar, I feel like I’m managing my tools more than my classes.”
Context: When describing how she organizes her daily schedule.
Why it matters: Shows the mental burden and inefficiency caused by scattered systems.

Quote 2: Missed critical updates
What they said (verbatim): “I didn’t know our project deadline was moved up — the update was buried in LMS announcements.”
Context: Recalling a past incident that led to a late submission.
Why it matters: Illustrates the academic consequences of fragmented and noisy communication channels.

Quote 3: Manual sync frustration
What they said (verbatim): “Every Sunday night I sit down and recheck every tool. It’s exhausting but necessary.”
Context: Describing her weekly planning habit.
Why it matters: Highlights the unsustainable effort students invest to stay organized.

Problem Deep Dive

The Story: What Happened
Natia shared how she once missed a marketing project deadline after assuming the original LMS date was still valid. The professor had changed it two days earlier through an LMS announcement that she didn’t notice. When she logged in the next morning, the assignment was already marked late. “I almost cried,” she said. “It wasn’t laziness — it was just buried.”

Since that event, she’s become hyper-vigilant about updates. Every Sunday, she checks LMS, Trello, and Google Calendar manually to verify every due date. She admits the process is “draining” but “the only way to avoid another disaster.”

Five Whys / Root Cause Exploration

Surface problem: Missed deadline due to untracked LMS update.

Why #1: Why was the update missed?
“Because it was only posted in LMS announcements.”

Why #2: Why didn’t she check LMS announcements?
“They’re cluttered — professors post too much random stuff there.”

Why #3: Why is it hard to filter important updates?
“There’s no distinction between major updates and small comments.”

Why #4: Why not check more often?
“It’s overwhelming and I rely on my calendar for quick reference.”

Why #5: Why can’t she centralize updates automatically?
“Nothing syncs — everything has to be copied by hand.”

Root cause assessment:
Information fragmentation and noisy communication channels cause students to miss updates and deadlines, creating high mental overhead and distrust in existing tools.

Emotional Impact

How did they describe feeling? Overwhelmed and anxious about missing details.
What words did they use? “Draining,” “messy,” “exhausting,” “I can’t relax.”
Physical/behavioural indicators: Frequent sighing and rubbing her temples when recalling incidents.
Impact on her life: Reduced sleep, decreased productivity, and loss of confidence in digital systems.

Frequency & Pattern

How often does this occur? Minor confusion weekly; serious issues 1–2 times per semester.
Is there a pattern? Always triggered by deadline changes or inconsistent professor updates.
Has the frequency changed over time? Increased as project workload and group coordination grew.
Other instances mentioned: Missed a quiz link shared only in Telegram group, not on LMS.

Current Solutions & Workarounds

What they currently do
Primary solution/workaround: Weekly manual sync session across all tools every Sunday night.
How they discovered it: After losing marks for missing two deadlines in a single month.
How long they have used it: Since early 2025.

What works

Ensures all upcoming tasks are visible in one place

Reduces risk of total oversight

What does not work

Takes 2+ hours each week

Still fails to catch mid-week updates

Increases stress rather than reducing it

Tools & Resources Used

Tools/apps/systems:

LMS (main source of deadlines and grades)

Trello (project and team task tracking)

Google Calendar (class times and reminders)

Telegram (group chats and deadline alerts)

Other resources:

Classmate reminders

Screenshot backups of announcements

Alternatives They Have Tried

Tried: ClickUp, Todoist, and physical planners.
Why abandoned: None could sync automatically with LMS or handle frequent changes easily.
Why current approach is “least bad”: Combines flexibility and familiarity even though it demands constant manual maintenance.

Key Insights & Learnings

Surprising Findings

Students invest several hours weekly just maintaining awareness.

Manual syncing has become normalized as part of student life.

Contradictions or Tensions

Desires automation but doesn’t fully trust it.

Professors’ inconsistent posting habits make systems unreliable.

Patterns Emerging

Fragmented tools are a universal source of cognitive load.

Students compensate through time-consuming, error-prone workarounds.

Questions Raised

What would build student trust in automated synchronization?

Could a unified dashboard reduce both anxiety and time waste?

How might better notification design prevent missed updates?

Confidence Level
