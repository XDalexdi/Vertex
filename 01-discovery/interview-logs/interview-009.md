Key Quotes (Verbatim)

Quote 1 – Tool overload

Context: Sharing an incident that led to a penalty.
Why it matters: Demonstrates the real academic consequences of missed information due to scattered communication.

“Every Sunday evening, I recheck all tools just to make sure I’m not missing anything. It takes forever.”
Context: Responding to a question about weekly organization habits.
Why it matters: Emphasizes the heavy manual workload and time cost students bear to maintain control.

Problem Deep Dive

The Story: What Happened
Natia recounted a week before midterms when she had overlapping project and quiz deadlines. She had logged all LMS due dates into Trello earlier in the semester. However, her professor posted a schedule change in an LMS announcement two days before the new deadline. She didn’t see it until the following morning — after the submission time had already passed. “I was shocked,” she said. “I thought I had two more days. It wasn’t even in the email.”

She emailed her professor, but the grade was marked late. The incident made her distrust her current system. Since then, she double-checks every date manually and updates her boards each week, which she admitted is “mentally exhausting.”

Five Whys / Root Cause Exploration

Surface problem: Missed deadline because of outdated personal tracking data.

Why #1: Why was her tracking data outdated?
“Because the deadline change was only in LMS announcements.”

Why #2: Why didn’t she see the announcement?
“I only check LMS once or twice a week — there’s too much clutter.”

Why #3: Why is LMS cluttered?
“Every professor posts random things — discussions, extra readings, reminders — it’s chaos.”

Why #4: Why doesn’t she check daily?
“I rely on my calendar and Trello. LMS just feels unreliable and messy.”

Why #5: Why can’t she consolidate information automatically?
“Nothing connects properly. I have to copy-paste everything myself.”

Root Cause Assessment:
Information fragmentation and poor LMS communication design create constant gaps in awareness. Students compensate with manual tracking, which increases workload and anxiety.

Emotional Impact

Feelings described: Overwhelmed, anxious, and tired.
Words used: “Draining,” “exhausting,” “messy,” “never-ending.”
Physical/behavioral indicators: Rubbed her forehead repeatedly during the interview, sighed often.
Impact on life: Sleep disruption before deadlines, decreased focus, and less motivation for extracurricular work.

Frequency & Pattern

How often: Minor confusion weekly, major deadline mix-ups 1–2 times per semester.
Pattern: Always occurs when announcements are posted late or inconsistently.
Change over time: Increasing frequency as workload and group projects expand.
Other instances: Missed quiz because professor used Google Docs instead of LMS to post the link.

Current Solutions & Workarounds

Primary solution/workaround: Weekly manual review and sync of all tools on Sunday nights.
How discovered: After missing two deadlines in a single month.
Duration: 8 months.

What works:

Keeps deadlines consolidated for short-term planning

Reduces complete misses

What doesn’t work:

Time-consuming (2+ hours weekly)

Does not prevent surprise updates midweek

Still heavily dependent on discipline and memory

Tools & Resources Used

Tools/Apps/Systems:

LMS (primary source of official info)

Trello (task breakdown and group work)

Google Calendar (time-based scheduling)

Telegram (communication and reminders)

Other resources:

Notes from classmates

Screenshot backups of announcements

Alternatives Tried

Tried: Todoist, ClickUp, and paper planners.
Why abandoned: Couldn’t sync with LMS or required too much setup time.
Why current approach is “least bad”: Allows flexibility with familiar tools even though it demands constant manual upkeep.

Key Insights & Learnings

Surprising Findings

Students normalize high-effort organization habits to maintain control.

Lack of integration between tools multiplies stress instead of reducing it.

Contradictions or Tensions

Professors’ inconsistent posting habits worsen tool chaos.

Patterns Emerging

Tool overload causes constant background anxiety.

Manual syncing is the only reliable safety net — at a major time cost.

What features would make students trust automated synchronization?

Could notifications be standardized across LMS and calendars?

How can systems reduce redundant effort while maintaining student control?
