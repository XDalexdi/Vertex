**Q3: Do you use multiple tools to manage academic deadlines?**  
A: Yes, Trello, Google Tasks, Outlook, and a physical planner.  

### ICP Match Assessment  
Extended match: Graduate student balancing coursework, part-time work, and freelance projects.  

## Interviewee Background  
### Relevant Demographics  
- **Year:** Second year Master’s  
- **Major:** Data Science  
- **Living situation:** Shared apartment  
- **Work status:** Part-time data analyst (15 hrs/week), freelance projects  
- **Other relevant info:** Volunteers as a mentor for first-year students  

### Context & Situation  
- **Course load:** 4 graduate courses  
- **Freelance work:** 2 ongoing client projects  
- **Mentorship:** Weekly sessions with mentees  
- **Relationship to Problem:** Manages overlapping deadlines from academic, professional, and volunteer roles  

### Current solutions they use:  
Trello for freelance projects, Google Tasks for personal deadlines, Outlook for university and work, physical planner for daily to-dos.  

### Pain level:  
Severe – describes "mental exhaustion from constant juggling"  

## Key Quotes (Verbatim)  
### Quote 1: Role-switching fatigue  
**What they said (verbatim):**  
"Switching from debugging code for a client to writing a research paper, then mentoring a student—all in one day—leaves me mentally drained. My tools don’t help me transition; they just remind me of the next deadline."  

**Context:**  
Explaining the challenge of shifting between different types of tasks.  

**Why it matters:**  
Highlights the cognitive cost of multi-role responsibility.  

### Quote 2: Inadequate tool flexibility  
**What they said (verbatim):**  
"I tried using Asana for everything, but it’s too rigid. My freelance tasks don’t fit the same structure as my academic assignments, and my mentorship duties don’t fit anywhere."  

**Context:**  
Discussing limitations of all-in-one project management tools.  

**Why it matters:**  
Shows that one-size-fits-all tools fail to accommodate varied workflows.  

### Quote 3: Consequences of dropped commitments  
**What they said (verbatim):**  
"I missed a client deliverable because it was buried under academic deadlines. The client was understanding, but it hurt my professional reputation."  

**Context:**  
Recalling a recent failure due to poor priority management.  

**Why it matters:**  
Demonstrates real-world impact of ineffective task management.  

## Problem Deep Dive  
### The Story: What Happened  
Luca had a critical week with two client deliverables, a midterm exam, and a mentorship workshop. He relied on Outlook and Trello but had no way to visually compare priorities across domains. He ended up prioritizing the exam, which caused him to deliver late work to a client. The client expressed disappointment, and Luca lost a potential long-term collaboration.  

He also forgot to prepare for the mentorship workshop, leading to an unproductive session. His mentees noticed his lack of preparation, which diminished their trust in him.  

The week left him feeling professionally unreliable and personally unfulfilled.  

### Five Whys / Root Cause Exploration  
**Surface problem:** Missed deadlines and unpreparedness across roles.  

**Why #1:** Why did you miss the client deadline?  
Their answer: "I didn’t realize it conflicted with my exam prep until it was too late."  

**Why #2:** Why didn’t you see the conflict earlier?  
Their answer: "My tools are siloed. Trello doesn’t talk to Outlook, and my physical planner doesn’t sync with either."  

**Why #3:** Why not use a single tool for everything?  
Their answer: "I’ve tried, but they’re either too simple or too complex. None understand that a client task and a homework assignment aren’t the same."  

**Why #4:** Why are these tasks treated the same?  
Their answer: "Because most tools are built for homogeneous workloads—either all academic or all professional."  

**Why #5:** Why is no one building for hybrid roles?  
Their answer: "Maybe because people like me—student-professionals—are still a niche audience."  

**Root cause assessment:** Graduate students with mixed roles lack tools that recognize and adapt to different task types and priorities.  

## Emotional Impact  
**How did they describe feeling?**  
Stretched thin, unreliable, and constantly behind.  

**What words did they use?**  
"Overextended," "anxious," "disappointed in myself," "burned out."  

**Physical/behavioural indicators:**  
Sighed frequently, paused often when recalling failures, avoided eye contact during emotional parts.  

**Impact on his life:**  
Sleep deprivation, reduced social interactions, doubting his ability to manage multiple roles.  

## Frequency & Pattern  
**How often does this occur?**  
Minor overlaps happen weekly; major conflicts occur monthly.  

**Is there a pattern?**  
Conflicts often arise between client work and academic deadlines.  

**Has the frequency changed over time?**  
Increased significantly since starting freelance work.  

**Other instances mentioned:**  
Forgot a mentorship meeting because it wasn’t integrated into his digital calendar.  

## Current Solutions & Workarounds  
### What They Currently Do  
**Primary solution/workaround:** Using separate tools per domain with manual cross-referencing.  

**How they discovered it:** Trial and error over the past year.  

**How long they have used it:** 10 months, with frequent tweaks.  

### What Works  
- Clear separation reduces clutter within each domain  
- Physical planner provides a tangible overview  

### What Does Not Work  
- No integration between systems  
- Manual updates are prone to error  
- No way to compare or weigh priorities across domains  

### Tools & Resources Used  
**Tools/apps/systems:**  
- Trello: Freelance project management  
- Outlook: University and part-time work schedule  
- Google Tasks: Personal and mentorship reminders  
- Physical planner: Daily task breakdown  

**Other resources:**  
- Weekly review with a peer  
- Time-blocking on Sundays  

### Alternatives They Have Tried  
- **Asana:** Too structured  
- **Notion:** Overwhelming to set up  
- **TickTick:** Too simplistic for professional use  

**Why current approach is "least bad":** It provides a visual and mental separation between roles.  

## Key Insights & Learnings  
### Surprising Findings  
The need isn’t just for task management—it’s for role-aware systems that help transition between mindsets.  

### Contradictions or Tensions  
Wants a unified view but fears it will oversimplify or misrepresent his responsibilities.  

### Patterns Emerging  
Hybrid roles (student + professional) break conventional productivity tools.  

### Questions Raised  
- How can tools help users mentally prepare for task switching?  
- Can we design for "role-based" prioritization?  
- How do we visually represent different types of deadlines?  

## Confidence Level  
☑ Confident  

**Why?** Consistent, detailed examples of multi-role challenges and clear emotional resonance.  

## Next Steps & Follow-Up  
### Referrals Provided  
Provided one referral: a peer in a similar situation (student + freelancer).  

### Future Contact  
☑ Participate in future testing  
☑ Be contacted for follow-up questions  
☑ Review a prototype  
☐ Join a beta test  

**Best way to reach them:** Email or LinkedIn  

## Interviewer Notes  
**What went well?** Deep dive into emotional and practical impact of multi-role management.  

**What could be improved?** Could have explored specific features for role-based task weighting.  

**Follow-up actions:**  
- Reach out to referral  
- Investigate tools that support role-based workflows  

## Post-Interview Reflection  
**Date logged:** 2025-11-05  
**Time to document:** 55 minutes  

**One-sentence summary:** Graduate students juggling academic, professional, and volunteer roles lack tools that recognize different task types and help manage mental transitions between responsibilities.
