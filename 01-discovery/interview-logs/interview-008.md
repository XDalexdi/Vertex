ICP Verification

Screener Questions & Responses

Q1: Are you currently a university student who uses the LMS regularly for coursework?
A: Yes, I log in almost every day for updates and assignments.

Q2: Do you submit assignments or check grades through the LMS?
A: Yes, everything — assignments, quizzes, and grades go through there.

Q3: Have you ever experienced any issues or frustrations while using it?
A: Constantly, especially when submitting files or checking deadlines.

ICP Match Assessment

The interviewee matches all ICP criteria: an active undergraduate student who interacts with the LMS multiple times weekly. He depends on it for grades, materials, and submissions, making his feedback highly relevant to reliability and usability concerns.

Interviewee Background

Year: Third-year
Major: Computer Science
Living Situation: On-campus dormitory
Work Status: None (focuses on full-time studies)
Device Usage: Laptop (daily), tablet (occasional use on the go)

Context & Situation

Uses LMS for 6 courses each semester.
Frequently uploads assignments, checks course announcements, and tracks grades.
Often accesses the platform during late evenings or weekends, when it’s busiest.

Relationship to Problem

How often experienced: Almost weekly, especially during deadlines.
How long it’s been a problem: Since his first semester.
Current solutions used: Refreshing repeatedly, taking screenshots, and confirming with professors via email.
Pain level: High — wastes time and causes unnecessary anxiety.

Key Quotes (Verbatim)

Quote 1 – Submission reliability

“It’s like gambling — sometimes the upload works, sometimes it doesn’t. I just hope for the best.”
Context: Describing the uncertainty when submitting projects.
Why it matters: Demonstrates lack of system reliability and user trust.

Quote 2 – Confusing confirmation feedback

“It says ‘submission received,’ but when I reopen the page, it’s empty again. I never know what’s real.”
Context: When asked how he knows his submission was successful.
Why it matters: Reflects unclear system feedback and poor communication design.

Quote 3 – Lack of mobile usability

“On my tablet, it’s a disaster. The buttons overlap, and half the pages don’t load properly.”
Context: When discussing accessing LMS during travel or away from his laptop.
Why it matters: Reveals inconsistent performance across devices and accessibility gaps.

Problem Deep Dive

The Story: What Happened

Giorgi recalled submitting a group project five minutes before the deadline. The file upload stalled halfway, showing a spinning loader for several minutes. After refreshing, he couldn’t tell if it had gone through. He quickly messaged his professor and teammates. Later, he discovered multiple duplicate submissions and a timestamp error that marked it as late. “I did everything right,” he said, “but the system made me look careless.”

He shared that this isn’t rare — “every big deadline week, it slows down or crashes.” Over time, he started submitting one hour early and saving screenshots as proof. “It’s exhausting,” he said, “I shouldn’t need backup plans for a school website.”

Notifications are also unreliable: “Sometimes I see new grades days later. My friends message me before the site even updates.” Despite frustrations, he continues using it daily because all courses mandate LMS use.

Five Whys / Root Cause Exploration

Surface problem: LMS failures and delays during critical submission periods.

Why #1: Why does it fail?
“Too many people use it at once — it just can’t handle the pressure.”

Why #2: Why is that important?
“Because one failed upload can cost grades or even a whole assignment.”

Why #3: Why is confirmation unclear?
“The system doesn’t give clear or reliable messages. Sometimes it lies.”

Why #4: Why hasn’t this been improved?
“The university says updates are coming, but we never see changes.”

Why #5: Why do students keep using it anyway?
“It’s mandatory — if we don’t, we risk missing assignments or grades.”

Root Cause Assessment:
Unreliable infrastructure and unclear feedback design undermine user trust. Institutional inertia and lack of accountability perpetuate user frustration, leading students to depend on external systems for reliability and communication.

Emotional Impact

Feelings described: Stressed, helpless, and annoyed.
Words used: “Hopeless,” “broken,” “unreliable,” “I hate checking it.”
Behavioral indicators: He sighed repeatedly, occasionally laughed in frustration.
Impact on life: Loss of time, reduced focus before deadlines, and dependency on redundant backups.

Frequency & Pattern

Occurrence: Weekly, most severe before Sunday or Monday deadlines.
Pattern: Fails most often under high load and on mobile devices.
Change over time: Worsened as more professors started using it for submissions.
Other examples: Friends missing notifications, files disappearing, or LMS downtime during midterms.

Current Solutions & Workarounds

Primary workaround: Submitting early, refreshing multiple times, and taking screenshots.
How discovered: Learned after repeated upload issues.
Duration of use: Nearly two years.

What works:

Provides evidence for disputes.

Reduces total failure risk.

What doesn’t work:

Adds unnecessary workload and anxiety.

Doesn’t build confidence in the system.

Tools & Resources Used

Email: For confirmation with professors.

Telegram: For updates from classmates.

Google Drive: For backup copies of submitted work.

Alternatives Tried

He once used Google Classroom in a summer course and described it as “smooth, fast, and stress-free.”
However, since his university mandates LMS usage, there are no viable alternatives.

Why current approach is “least bad”: Reliance on early submission and screenshots provides minimal control in an unreliable environment.

Key Insights & Learnings

Surprising Findings

Students accept technical failures as a routine part of academic life.

Trust is so low that “proof of submission” feels more important than grades.

Emotional frustration stems from uncertainty, not just downtime.

Contradictions or Tensions

Students dislike the system but depend on it completely.

Both students and professors have developed personal workarounds instead of demanding fixes.

Patterns Emerging

Unclear confirmation messages are a universal complaint.

Reliability concerns dominate all other usability feedback.

Questions Raised

Would visible upload progress or email confirmation reduce anxiety?

Are system lags due to server capacity or poor optimization?

How can transparency be built into the submission process?

Confidence Level

Confidence: Moderate to high.
Reason: Giorgi described detailed, recurring issues that align with patterns seen in previous interviews. Further validation needed across different faculties and devices.

Next Steps & Follow-Up

Referrals Provided:
He mentioned two classmates who experienced similar double-submission errors.

Interviewer Notes

What went well: Giorgi’s technical background helped him articulate system flaws clearly. Emotional honesty strengthened the findings.
What could be improved: I should ask next interviewees more about how LMS issues affect group work coordination.

Follow-up actions:

Interview referred classmates for triangulation.

Investigate submission timestamp discrepancies.

Explore potential design solutions for feedback and confirmation clarity.

Post-Interview Reflection

Date logged: 2025-10-26
Time to document: 40 minutes

One-sentence summary:
Students experience chronic anxiety and inefficiency due to unreliable LMS performance and unclear submission feedback, fostering deep mistrust and redundant backup behaviors.
