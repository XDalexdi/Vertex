## ICP Verification  
**Does the interviewee match our ICP?** Yes

### Screener Questions & Responses  
**Q1: Are you currently a university student who uses the LMS regularly for coursework?**  
A: Yes, I log in almost every day for updates and assignments.

**Q2: Do you submit assignments or check grades through the LMS?**  
A: Yes, everything — assignments, quizzes, and grades go through there.

**Q3: Have you ever experienced any issues or frustrations while using it?**  
A: Constantly, especially when submitting files or checking deadlines.

### ICP Match Assessment  
The interviewee matches all ICP criteria: an active undergraduate student who interacts with the LMS multiple times weekly. He depends on it for grades, materials, and submissions, making his feedback highly relevant to reliability and usability concerns.

## Interviewee Background  
### Relevant Demographics  
- **Year:** Third-year  
- **Major:** Computer Science  
- **Living situation:** On-campus dormitory  
- **Work status:** None (focuses on full-time studies)  
- **Other relevant info:** Technical background helps articulate system flaws clearly

### Context & Situation  
- **Course load:** 6 courses each semester  
- **LMS usage:** Daily for assignments, announcements, and grades  
- **Access patterns:** Often during late evenings or weekends when system is busiest  
- **Relationship to Problem:** Dependent on unreliable system for critical academic functions

### Current solutions they use:  
Refreshing repeatedly, taking screenshots, confirming with professors via email.

### Pain level:  
High – describes "chronic anxiety" and "wasted time"

## Key Quotes (Verbatim)  
### Quote 1: Submission reliability  
**What they said (verbatim):**  
"It's like gambling — sometimes the upload works, sometimes it doesn't. I just hope for the best."

**Context:**  
Describing the uncertainty when submitting projects.

**Why it matters:**  
Demonstrates lack of system reliability and user trust.

### Quote 2: Confusing confirmation feedback  
**What they said (verbatim):**  
"It says 'submission received,' but when I reopen the page, it's empty again. I never know what's real."

**Context:**  
When asked how he knows his submission was successful.

**Why it matters:**  
Reflects unclear system feedback and poor communication design.

### Quote 3: Lack of mobile usability  
**What they said (verbatim):**  
"On my tablet, it's a disaster. The buttons overlap, and half the pages don't load properly."

**Context:**  
When discussing accessing LMS during travel or away from his laptop.

**Why it matters:**  
Reveals inconsistent performance across devices and accessibility gaps.

## Problem Deep Dive  
### The Story: What Happened  
Giorgi recalled submitting a group project five minutes before the deadline. The file upload stalled halfway, showing a spinning loader for several minutes. After refreshing, he couldn't tell if it had gone through. He quickly messaged his professor and teammates. Later, he discovered multiple duplicate submissions and a timestamp error that marked it as late. "I did everything right," he said, "but the system made me look careless."

He shared that this isn't rare — "every big deadline week, it slows down or crashes." Over time, he started submitting one hour early and saving screenshots as proof. "It's exhausting," he said, "I shouldn't need backup plans for a school website."

Notifications are also unreliable: "Sometimes I see new grades days later. My friends message me before the site even updates." Despite frustrations, he continues using it daily because all courses mandate LMS use.

### Five Whys / Root Cause Exploration  
**Surface problem:** LMS failures and delays during critical submission periods.

**Why #1:** Why does it fail?  
Their answer: "Too many people use it at once — it just can't handle the pressure."

**Why #2:** Why is that important?  
Their answer: "Because one failed upload can cost grades or even a whole assignment."

**Why #3:** Why is confirmation unclear?  
Their answer: "The system doesn't give clear or reliable messages. Sometimes it lies."

**Why #4:** Why hasn't this been improved?  
Their answer: "The university says updates are coming, but we never see changes."

**Why #5:** Why do students keep using it anyway?  
Their answer: "It's mandatory — if we don't, we risk missing assignments or grades."

**Root cause assessment:** Unreliable infrastructure and unclear feedback design undermine user trust. Institutional inertia and lack of accountability perpetuate user frustration.

## Emotional Impact  
**How did they describe feeling?**  
Stressed, helpless, and annoyed.

**What words did they use?**  
"Hopeless," "broken," "unreliable," "I hate checking it."

**Physical/behavioural indicators:**  
Sighed repeatedly, occasionally laughed in frustration.

**Impact on his life:**  
Loss of time, reduced focus before deadlines, and dependency on redundant backups.

## Frequency & Pattern  
**How often does this occur?**  
Weekly, most severe before Sunday or Monday deadlines.

**Is there a pattern?**  
Fails most often under high load and on mobile devices.

**Has the frequency changed over time?**  
Worsened as more professors started using it for submissions.

**Other instances mentioned:**  
Friends missing notifications, files disappearing, or LMS downtime during midterms.

## Current Solutions & Workarounds  
### What They Currently Do  
**Primary solution/workaround:** Submitting early, refreshing multiple times, and taking screenshots.

**How they discovered it:** Learned after repeated upload issues.

**How long they have used it:** Nearly two years.

### What Works  
- Provides evidence for disputes  
- Reduces total failure risk

### What Does Not Work  
- Adds unnecessary workload and anxiety  
- Doesn't build confidence in the system

### Tools & Resources Used  
**Tools/apps/systems:**  
- Email: For confirmation with professors  
- Telegram: For updates from classmates  
- Google Drive: For backup copies of submitted work

**Other resources:**  
- Screenshots of submission confirmations  
- Early submission habit

### Alternatives They Have Tried  
- **Google Classroom:** Used in summer course, described as "smooth, fast, and stress-free"

**Why current approach is "least bad":** Reliance on early submission and screenshots provides minimal control in an unreliable environment.

## Key Insights & Learnings  
### Surprising Findings  
Students accept technical failures as a routine part of academic life.

### Contradictions or Tensions  
Students dislike the system but depend on it completely.

### Patterns Emerging  
Unclear confirmation messages are a universal complaint.

### Questions Raised  
- Would visible upload progress or email confirmation reduce anxiety?  
- How can transparency be built into the submission process?

## Confidence Level  
☑ Confident

**Why?** Detailed, recurring issues that align with patterns seen in previous interviews.

## Next Steps & Follow-Up  
### Referrals Provided  
Provided two classmates who experienced similar double-submission errors.

### Future Contact  
☑ Be contacted for follow-up questions  
☑ Participate in prototype testing  
☑ Review design mock-ups

**Best way to reach them:** Email

## Interviewer Notes  
**What went well?** Technical background helped articulate system flaws clearly. Emotional honesty strengthened the findings.

**What could be improved?** Should ask next interviewees more about how LMS issues affect group work coordination.

**Follow-up actions:**  
- Interview referred classmates for triangulation  
- Investigate submission timestamp discrepancies

## Post-Interview Reflection  
**Date logged:** 2025-10-26  
**Time to document:** 40 minutes

**One-sentence summary:** Students experience chronic anxiety and inefficiency due to unreliable LMS performance and unclear submission feedback, fostering deep mistrust and redundant backup behaviors.
