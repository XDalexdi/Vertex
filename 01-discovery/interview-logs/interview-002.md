Extended match: Graduate student with more complex multi-domain management needs.
 
## Interviewee Background
### Relevant Demographics
- **Year:** First year Master's
- **Major:** Computer Science
- **Living situation:** Off-campus apartment
- **Work status:** Research assistant (20 hrs/week)
- **Other relevant info:** Teaching assistant for undergraduate course
 
### Context & Situation
- **Course load:** 3 graduate courses
- **Research:** Thesis research with weekly milestones
- **Teaching:** TA for Data Structures course
- **Relationship to Problem:** Manages deadlines across 3 different domains daily
 
### Current solutions they use:
Notion for research, Google Calendar for teaching, LMS for courses, Todoist for personal tasks.
 
### Pain level: 
Severe – describes "constant context switching"
 
## Key Quotes (Verbatim)
### Quote 1: Multi-domain overload
**What they said (verbatim):**
"I'm not just managing courses anymore. I have research deadlines that affect my funding, teaching responsibilities that affect my employment, and course deadlines that affect my GPA. They all have different stakeholders and consequences."
 
**Context:**
Explaining how graduate school differs from undergraduate.
 
**Why it matters:**
Shows exponential complexity increase in graduate deadline management.
 
### Quote 2: Custom solution burden
**What they said (verbatim):**
"I wrote Python scripts to sync my systems, but maintaining them has become another part-time job. I'm basically my own IT department now."
 
**Context:**
Discussing solutions they've built to manage their workflow.
 
**Why it matters:**
Highlights the technical overhead of current workarounds.
 
### Quote 3: Priority conflicts
**What they said (verbatim):**
"Last month I had to choose between preparing a conference paper that could define my career and grading 80 undergraduate assignments. There's no system that understands these aren't comparable tasks."
 
**Context:**
Describing impossible choices between different types of deadlines.
 
**Why it matters:**
Reveals need for context-aware priority management.
 
## Problem Deep Dive
### The Story: What Happened
Maria faced a perfect storm during mid-semester. Her advisor scheduled an unexpected research presentation the same week she had two course project deadlines and 80 programming assignments to grade. She tried to manage everything in Google Calendar, but the different types of work required different mental modes and preparation time.
 
The research presentation suffered because she prepared it in fragments between grading sessions. The course projects were rushed the night before deadlines. The grading was late, causing undergraduate complaints to the course professor. Her research advisor was disappointed with the presentation quality, and one course professor commented on the declined project quality.
 
The consequence was damage to multiple professional relationships and self-doubt about her ability to handle graduate school demands. She started experiencing anxiety attacks and visited campus counseling services.
 
### Five Whys / Root Cause Exploration
**Surface problem:** Poor performance across multiple domains due to scheduling conflict.
 
**Why #1:** Why couldn't you manage the conflicting deadlines?
Their answer: "My calendar showed the time blocks, but not the mental preparation each task required."
 
**Why #2:** Why didn't you account for preparation time?
Their answer: "There's no way to represent that in any tool I use. Everything looks like a simple calendar event."
 
**Why #3:** Why don't you use more sophisticated tools?
Their answer: "I've tried everything, but they're all designed for single-domain use - either business or simple student life."
 
**Why #4:** Why are there no tools for graduate student workflows?
Their answer: "It's a niche market, and our workflows are too complex and varied."
 
**Why #5:** Why are graduate workflows so complex?
Their answer: "Because we're simultaneously students, researchers, teachers, and professionals."
 
**Root cause assessment:** Graduate students operate across multiple professional domains with different requirements, and no tools understand these context differences.
 
## Emotional Impact
**How did they describe feeling?**
Inadequate, overwhelmed, and professionally vulnerable.
 
**What words did they use?**
"Inadequate," "overwhelmed," "professionally vulnerable," "imposter syndrome."
 
**Physical/behavioural indicators:**
Voice cracked when discussing advisor's feedback, frequently rubbed temples.
 
**Impact on her life:**
Anxiety attacks, strained advisor relationship, questioning career choice.
 
## Frequency & Pattern
**How often does this occur?**
Weekly minor conflicts, major crises 2-3 times per semester.
 
**Is there a pattern?**
Always involves conflicts between different domains (research vs teaching vs courses).
 
**Has the frequency changed over time?**
Dramatically increased with transition to graduate school.
 
**Other instances mentioned:**
Missed research group meeting because it conflicted with teaching office hours.
 
## Current Solutions & Workarounds
### What They Currently Do
**Primary solution/workaround:** Domain-separated systems with manual integration points.
 
**How they discovered it:** Evolved through failure and experimentation.
 
**How long they have used it:** 6 months with constant adjustments.
 
### What Works
- Separation reduces cognitive load within domains
- Custom scripts automate some data flow
 
### What Does Not Work
- Manual integration is time-consuming
- No cross-domain priority management
- Systems don't understand context differences
 
### Tools & Resources Used
**Tools/apps/systems:**
- Notion: Research management and notes
- Google Calendar: Teaching schedule and meetings
- LMS: Course management
- Todoist: Personal task tracking
- Custom Python scripts: Data synchronization
 
**Other resources:**
- Weekly planning with accountability partner
- Color-coded physical calendar
 
### Alternatives They Have Tried
- **Microsoft Outlook:** Too email-centric
- **Apple Calendar:** Too simple for complex needs
- **Various research management tools:** Too specialized for other domains
 
**Why current approach is "least bad":** Provides some automation while maintaining domain separation.
 
## Key Insights & Learnings
### Surprising Findings
Graduate students need context-aware systems that understand different types of work, not just time management.
 
### Contradictions or Tensions
Wants integration but also needs to maintain separation between professional domains.
 
### Patterns Emerging
The transition from undergraduate to graduate represents a quantum leap in complexity that breaks existing tools.
 
### Questions Raised
- How do we design for multi-domain professionals?
- What does context-aware scheduling look like?
- How can we reduce the technical burden of custom solutions?
 
## Confidence Level
☑ Confident
 
**Why?** Clear articulation of graduate-specific challenges with emotional depth.
 
## Next Steps & Follow-Up
### Referrals Provided
Provided two other graduate student contacts from different departments.
 
### Future Contact
☑ Participate in future testing
☑ Be contacted for follow-up questions
☑ Review a prototype
☑ Join a beta test
 
**Best way to reach them:** Email or campus messaging
 
## Interviewer Notes
**What went well?** Good exploration of multi-domain challenges and technical solution attempts.
 
**What could be improved?** Should have asked about specific features for context-awareness.
 
**Follow-up actions:**
- Contact graduate student referrals
- Explore multi-domain workflow requirements
 
## Post-Interview Reflection
**Date logged:** 2025-10-22
**Time to document:** 50 minutes
 
**One-sentence summary:** Graduate students face impossible multi-domain conflicts with no tools that understand context differences between research, teaching, and coursework.
