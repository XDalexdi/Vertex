## Verbatim Quotes
> "I have color-coded Excel sheets for each course, but when professors change deadlines, it creates a domino effect of updates across all my files."
> 
> "The worst is when group members rely on me to remind them about deadlines. It adds this extra layer of responsibility that I didn't sign up for."
> 
> "I actually dream about missing deadlines during exam season. It sounds ridiculous, but it shows how much mental space this occupies."
 
## Problem Deep Dive Narrative

David uses an elaborate Excel-based system with color coding for priority levels. He showed me his spreadsheet with 15+ columns tracking everything from submission status to estimated completion time.
 
**First Why:** Why such a complex system? "Because simple tools don't capture the nuances. Some assignments have multiple components, some depend on group members, some have flexible deadlines."
 
**Second Why:** What breaks in your current system? "When things change last minute. Last week, a professor moved a deadline up by two days, and I didn't find out until the day before it was due. I had to pull an all-nighter."
 
**Third Why:** How do you find out about changes? "Usually through classmates in WhatsApp groups. But sometimes people forget to share important updates."
 
**Fourth Why:** What's the consequence of missing updates? "Beyond grades, it damages my reputation. In business courses, being reliable matters for group work selections and professor recommendations."
 
**Fifth Why:** Why does reputation matter so much? "Because networking and relationships are everything in business. If I'm seen as disorganized, it affects future opportunities."
