## Interviewee Background
Second-year Computer Science student taking 6 technical courses. Works part-time as a tutor. Lives on campus and is involved in two student clubs.

## Verbatim Quotes
> "I literally missed a programming assignment last week because it was buried in the LMS discussion forum. The professor posted an update and I never saw it."
> 
> "I have Google Calendar for personal stuff, Notion for project planning, and the university LMS for actual assignments. It's exhausting trying to keep them all in sync."
> 
> "During midterms, I had three assignments due within 24 hours and I completely forgot about one until my friend messaged me asking if I'd submitted it. I felt so stupid and panicked."

## Problem Deep Dive Narrative
The interview began with Maria describing her current system. She uses Google Calendar for classes and personal events, Notion for project breakdowns, and the university LMS for assignment details and submissions.

**First Why:** Why use three different systems? "Because each one does something better. Google Calendar is easy for quick entries, Notion lets me break down complex projects, and the LMS has the official deadlines."

**Second Why:** What happens when systems aren't synced? "Last month, I updated a deadline in Notion but forgot to update Google Calendar. I almost missed a quiz because my calendar reminder was for the wrong date."

**Third Why:** How does that affect your academic performance? "I lost 15% on that programming assignment I mentioned. But worse than the grade, it made me doubt my organizational skills. I spent the next week constantly checking all my systems, which wasted so much time."

**Fourth Why:** What's the emotional impact? "It's incredibly stressful. I lie awake at night mentally running through my task lists, worried I've forgotten something important. During busy weeks, I avoid social plans because I'm afraid I'll miss a deadline."

**Fifth Why:** Why does this particular stress stand out? "Because it feels preventable. If I just had one place that showed everything clearly, I could actually relax and trust my system. Right now, I don't trust any single tool to have the complete picture."

## Current Solutions & Workarounds
- **Manual sync every Sunday:** Spends 1-2 hours each week copying deadlines between systems
- **Peer dependency:** Has a "deadline buddy" in each class to cross-check assignments
- **Physical notebook:** Keeps a backup written list but often forgets to update it
- **Phone alarms:** Sets multiple reminders for important deadlines

## Key Insights & Surprises
1. **Surprise:** The emotional toll is greater than expected - students experience genuine anxiety about missing deadlines
2. **Insight:** Peer reliance is a critical safety net, not just convenience
3. **Contradiction:** While students want automation, they don't fully trust automated systems to be accurate

## Next Steps & Follow-ups
- Explore how different majors manage deadlines (CS vs Business vs Engineering)
- Investigate the specific pain points with LMS notifications
- Ask for referral to other students experiencing similar issues
