The interviewee matches our ICP perfectly: 20-year-old CS student using multiple tools for deadline management. Strong fit for understanding tool fragmentation pain points.

## Interviewee Background
### Relevant Demographics
- **Year:** Second year
- **Major:** Computer Science
- **Living situation:** On-campus dormitory
- **Work status:** No job
- **Other relevant info:** Part of programming club

### Context & Situation
- **Course load:** 6 courses including Data Structures and Web Development
- **Group projects:** Currently in 2 group projects
- **Extracurriculars:** Programming club meetings twice weekly
- **Relationship to Problem:** Experiences deadline stress weekly, especially during midterms

### Current solutions they use:
Google Calendar for classes, Notion for project planning, LMS for assignments, WhatsApp for group coordination.

### Pain level: 
High – reports constant anxiety about missing deadlines.

## Key Quotes (Verbatim)
### Quote 1: Tool overload
**What they said (verbatim):**
"I have to check four different apps every morning just to know what I need to do today. By the time I'm done checking everything, I've wasted 30 minutes and I'm already stressed."

**Context:**
This was in response to asking about their morning routine for checking tasks.

**Why it matters:**
Shows the significant time cost and mental toll of managing multiple disconnected systems.

### Quote 2: Missing critical deadlines
**What they said (verbatim):**
"I missed a programming assignment worth 15% because the professor posted it in LMS announcements instead of assignments. I didn't find out until a week later."

**Context:**
Describing a specific incident that affected their grade significantly.

**Why it matters:**
Demonstrates real academic consequences due to information fragmentation.

### Quote 3: Manual sync frustration
**What they said (verbatim):**
"Every Sunday I spend two hours copying deadlines from LMS to Google Calendar to Notion. It feels like I'm working as my own personal assistant instead of studying."

**Context:**
When asked about their weekly planning routine.

**Why it matters:**
Highlights the unsustainable manual overhead of current solutions.

## Problem Deep Dive
### The Story: What Happened
Mark described the recent midterm week where he had 3 assignments due within 48 hours. He had recorded the deadlines in Google Calendar but forgot to sync a deadline change announced in LMS. When he opened LMS on Tuesday morning, he discovered a Web Development project was due that day at 5 PM, not Thursday as he had in his calendar.

Panic set in immediately. He skipped all his classes that day, worked frantically for 8 hours straight, and submitted 30 minutes before deadline. The quality suffered significantly, and he received a B- instead of his usual A. The stress caused him to perform poorly on an exam the next day, creating a domino effect.

The consequence was not just the lower grade but lasting anxiety about his organizational system. He now checks every platform 3-4 times daily, which consumes even more time and mental energy.

### Five Whys / Root Cause Exploration
**Surface problem:** Missed deadline due to incorrect calendar information.

**Why #1:** Why was the calendar incorrect?
Their answer: "The professor changed the deadline in LMS announcements and I didn't see it."

**Why #2:** Why didn't you see the announcement?
Their answer: "I only check LMS announcements once a week because there's too much noise."

**Why #3:** Why is there too much noise?
Their answer: "Professors post everything there - readings, announcements, reminders, changes. Important stuff gets buried."

**Why #4:** Why don't you check more frequently?
Their answer: "I don't have time to sift through everything daily. I'm already overwhelmed."

**Why #5:** Why are you overwhelmed?
Their answer: "Because I'm spending all my time managing my systems instead of actually doing the work."

**Root cause assessment:** Information overload in primary systems leads to avoidance behavior, causing critical updates to be missed.

## Emotional Impact
**How did they describe feeling?**
Anxious, overwhelmed, and frustrated with himself.

**What words did they use?**
"Panic," "constant anxiety," "frustrating," "overwhelmed."

**Physical/behavioural indicators:**
Voice trembled when recalling the incident, frequent sighs during the conversation.

**Impact on his life:**
Lost sleep, skipped social activities, constant background anxiety about missing deadlines.

## Frequency & Pattern
**How often does this occur?**
Minor issues weekly, major incidents like missed deadlines 1-2 times per semester.

**Is there a pattern?**
Always happens when information is fragmented across systems or when last-minute changes occur.

**Has the frequency changed over time?**
Increased as course load became more complex in second year.

**Other instances mentioned:**
Almost missed a group project meeting because the time was only in WhatsApp chat, not in his calendar.

## Current Solutions & Workarounds
### What They Currently Do
**Primary solution/workaround:** Manual Sunday sync session where he updates all systems.

**How they discovered it:** After first major missed deadline incident.

**How long they have used it:** Since start of this academic year.

### What Works
- Having one consolidated view for the week ahead
- Reduced frequency of major missed deadlines

### What Does Not Work
- Time consuming (2-3 hours weekly)
- Doesn't catch mid-week changes
- Still relies on manual discipline

### Tools & Resources Used
**Tools/apps/systems:**
- University LMS: Primary source but poorly organized
- Google Calendar: For time-based scheduling
- Notion: For project breakdowns and notes
- WhatsApp: For group coordination

**Other resources:**
- Peer reminders from classmates
- Physical whiteboard in dorm room

### Alternatives They Have Tried
- **Todoist:** Abandoned because it didn't sync with LMS
- **Microsoft To Do:** Too simple for complex academic needs
- **Physical planner:** Couldn't handle frequent changes

**Why current approach is "least bad":** It provides some consolidation while using familiar tools.

## Key Insights & Learnings
### Surprising Findings
The manual overhead is much higher than expected - 2-3 hours weekly just on system maintenance.

### Contradictions or Tensions
Wants automation but doesn't trust automated systems to be accurate and complete.

### Patterns Emerging
Tool fragmentation creates both time cost and mental burden that affects academic performance.

### Questions Raised
- Why do students tolerate such high manual overhead?
- What would make students trust an automated system?
- How can we reduce the cognitive load of system management?

## Confidence Level
☑ Confident

**Why?** Clear, specific examples with emotional depth. Pattern aligns with our initial hypothesis but reveals greater severity.

## Next Steps & Follow-Up
### Referrals Provided
Provided contact for two roommates experiencing similar issues.

### Future Contact
☑ Participate in future testing
☑ Be contacted for follow-up questions
☐ Review a prototype
☐ Join a beta test

**Best way to reach them:** Email

## Interviewer Notes
**What went well?** Built good rapport quickly by relating to academic stress. Good use of silence after emotional moments.

**What could be improved?** Should have dug deeper into why they don't trust automation.

**Follow-up actions:**
- Contact provided referrals
- Explore automation trust issues in future interviews

## Post-Interview Reflection
**Date logged:** 2025-10-18
**Time to document:** 45 minutes

**One-sentence summary:** Tool fragmentation causes significant time waste and anxiety, leading to real academic consequences despite extensive manual workarounds.
