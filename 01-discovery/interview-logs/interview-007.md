## Problem Deep Dive

### The Story: What Happened
Pierre missed a crucial midterm review session because the professor announced the date and time verbally during a fast-paced lecture. Pierre misunderstood the time due to the use of "noon" instead of "12 PM," which he was unfamiliar with. He showed up an hour late and missed key instructions for the midterm.

As a result, he performed poorly on the exam, scoring below the class average. This impacted his overall grade and triggered anxiety about meeting the academic requirements for his scholarship, which requires a minimum B average.

### Five Whys / Root Cause Exploration

**Surface problem:** Missed review session leading to poor exam performance.

**Why #1:** Why did you miss the review session?
Their answer: "I misunderstood the time the professor said."

**Why #2:** Why did you misunderstand the time?
Their answer: "He said 'noon' and I wasn't sure if that meant 12 AM or 12 PM."

**Why #3:** Why didn't you confirm with someone?
Their answer: "I was embarrassed to ask. In France, we use 24-hour time, so I didn't want to seem stupid."

**Why #4:** Why was there no written reminder?
Their answer: "The professor only announced it in class. No post online, no email."

**Why #5:** Why does this keep happening?
Their answer: "I'm not used to the communication style here. I assume I understand, but sometimes I don't."

**Root cause assessment:** International students struggle with nuanced language, cultural communication norms, and inconsistent academic protocols, leading to critical misunderstandings.

## Emotional Impact

**How did they describe feeling?**
Anxious, embarrassed, and constantly behind.

Often related to spoken instructions, informal language, or ambiguous deadlines.

Slightly improved with experience, but stress remains high.

Misunderstood a group project deadline due to a casual Slack message.
