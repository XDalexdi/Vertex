Screener Questions & Responses

Q1: Are you currently a university student who uses the LMS regularly for coursework?
A: Yes, every week for most of my classes.

Q2: Do you submit assignments or check grades through the LMS?
A: Yes, I do both — that’s where everything is posted.

Q3: Have you ever experienced any issues or frustrations while using it?
A: Definitely, all the time.

ICP Match Assessment

The interviewee fits all ICP criteria: an active undergraduate student who frequently interacts with the LMS for submissions, grades, and materials. Their experiences directly reflect ongoing user challenges with the current platform.

Interviewee Background
Relevant Demographics

Year: Second-year

Major: Business Administration

Living Situation: Off-campus, commutes daily

Work Status: Part-time job (15 hours/week)

Device Usage: Laptop (primary), smartphone (secondary)

Context & Situation

Uses LMS for 5 courses per semester.

Uploads assignments, checks deadlines, and views grades multiple times weekly.

Relies on the system during commuting hours, especially before deadlines.

Relationship to Problem

How often they experience it: At least weekly, especially before deadlines.

How long it has been a problem: Since the start of the first year.

Current solutions used: Submitting early, emailing professors as backup, checking Telegram class groups for updates.

Pain level: High — repeated frustration and wasted time.

Key Quotes (Verbatim)

Quote 1: Submission reliability

“Sometimes the LMS just freezes when I try to upload a file, and I never know if it actually went through.”

Context:
While describing her process of submitting assignments close to deadlines.

Why it matters:
Shows the lack of trust and reliability in the core system function — file submission.

Quote 2: Confusing confirmation feedback

“It says something like ‘File received,’ but when I refresh, it’s gone. I have to redo the whole thing.”

Context:
Came up when asked what happens after submitting a file.

Why it matters:
Highlights unclear feedback design leading to repeated actions and user anxiety.

Quote 3: Lack of mobile usability

“When I open it on my phone, half the buttons don’t even work. It’s faster to just open my laptop.”

Context:
In response to a question about mobile use.

Why it matters:
Indicates poor cross-device usability and accessibility problems.

Problem Deep Dive
The Story: What Happened

Nino described a recent experience submitting her midterm report. She uploaded the file through the LMS ten minutes before the deadline. The page froze midway and showed an error. She reloaded the site and saw no confirmation. In panic, she emailed the professor directly with the file and a screenshot. Later that day, she found the submission had appeared twice — once incomplete and once final. The professor deducted late penalties because timestamps were unclear.

This isn’t an isolated event. She said, “It happens at least once every few weeks,” especially when many students are submitting simultaneously. Over time, she developed a routine: upload early, take a screenshot, and double-check via email. She expressed that it “takes extra effort for something that should just work.”

Her frustration extends beyond uploads. Notifications for changed deadlines or grades sometimes arrive hours late or not at all. The LMS design feels outdated, and she described it as “slow and cluttered.” Despite these issues, she still relies on it daily because professors require it.

Five Whys / Root Cause Exploration

Surface problem: The LMS fails or lags during critical submission times.

Why #1: Why does it fail?

“Probably because everyone’s submitting at once. It just can’t handle the load.”

Why #2: Why is that a big problem?

“Because missing a submission deadline means losing points, even if it’s the system’s fault.”

Why #3: Why do you feel uncertain about submissions?

“There’s no clear message or email confirmation, so I never know if it’s saved.”

Why #4: Why hasn’t this been fixed or reported effectively?

“Everyone complains, but the university says ‘it’s being updated soon,’ which never happens.”

Why #5: Why do students keep using it despite frustration?

“We have no choice. All assignments go through there — we just have to deal with it.”

Root Cause Assessment:
Students experience high stress and wasted time due to unreliable system performance, unclear feedback, and lack of transparency. Institutional inertia prevents improvements, leading to learned helplessness and parallel workarounds (email, Telegram).

Emotional Impact:

How did they describe feeling?
Stressed, anxious, and annoyed, especially when deadlines approach.

What words did they use?
“Frustrated,” “waste of time,” “panic,” “I don’t trust it.”

Physical/behavioural indicators:
Sighed repeatedly when describing upload failures; laughed nervously when recalling penalties.

Impact on life:
Lost time, reduced confidence in technology, and extra mental load from double-checking everything.

Frequency & Pattern

How often does this occur?
Weekly; especially during high submission times (Sunday evenings, exam weeks).

Is there a pattern?
Yes — errors spike under heavy traffic and on mobile.

Has frequency changed over time?
She said it has worsened as more courses adopted the LMS.

Other instances mentioned:
Friends missing grades or losing uploaded files. Some teachers avoid using the LMS for major assignments due to reliability concerns.

Current Solutions & Workarounds

Primary workaround: Submitting early and keeping screenshots.
How discovered: Learned after multiple failed submissions.
Duration of use: Over one year.

What works:

Reduces risk of total failure.

Provides proof of submission for disputes.

What does not work:

Adds unnecessary stress and effort.

Doesn’t solve the underlying trust issue.

Tools & Resources Used

Email: Backup for failed uploads.

Telegram: Group coordination and deadline reminders.

Google Drive: Alternative sharing method when LMS crashes.

Alternatives Tried

None available (university mandates LMS use).

Occasionally used Google Classroom in one course — much smoother experience.

Why current approach is “least bad”:
The LMS is mandatory; students rely on early submission and backups rather than system reliability.

Key Insights & Learnings
Surprising Findings

Students assume system failure as normal and plan around it.

Trust erosion has led to parallel systems (Telegram, email).

Emotional stress is linked to lack of transparency, not just downtime.

Contradictions or Tensions

Students blame the system but continue relying on it daily.

Professors also distrust the LMS, reinforcing the cycle of unreliability.

Patterns Emerging

Every interviewee so far mentions unclear confirmation and upload anxiety.

Reliability outweighs feature requests or design complaints.

Questions Raised

Would automated confirmations (email or message) rebuild trust?

Are the problems technical (server overload) or design-related (feedback clarity)?

How can the LMS reduce user anxiety during submissions?

Confidence Level
 Somewhat confident

Why: The interviewee provided detailed, emotional examples and repeated patterns over time. More interviews are needed to confirm if the reliability problem is universal or device-specific.

Next Steps & Follow-Up
Referrals Provided

She offered to connect me with two classmates who “always complain about the same thing.”

Interviewer Notes

What went well:
Building rapport early helped the conversation flow naturally. The “Five Whys” questions revealed emotional depth behind technical complaints.

What could be improved:
I should have probed more into professors’ use of LMS tools for grading and communication.

Follow-up actions:

Interview the two referrals she suggested.

Ask next interviewees specifically about trust vs. usability issues.

Investigate whether mobile failures align with submission stress.

Post-Interview Reflection
Date logged: 2025-10-20
Time to document: 45 minutes
One-sentence summary:
Students experience constant stress and wasted time due to unreliable LMS submissions and unclear confirmation messages, leading to distrust and dependence on external tools.
