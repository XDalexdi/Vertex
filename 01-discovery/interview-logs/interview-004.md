## ICP Verification  
**Does the interviewee match our ICP?** Yes

### Screener Questions & Responses  
**Q1: Are you currently a university student who uses the LMS regularly for coursework?**  
A: Yes, every week for most of my classes.

**Q2: Do you submit assignments or check grades through the LMS?**  
A: Yes, I do both — that's where everything is posted.

**Q3: Have you ever experienced any issues or frustrations while using it?**  
A: Definitely, all the time.

### ICP Match Assessment  
The interviewee fits all ICP criteria: an active undergraduate student who frequently interacts with the LMS for submissions, grades, and materials. Their experiences directly reflect ongoing user challenges with the current platform.

## Interviewee Background  
### Relevant Demographics  
- **Year:** Second-year  
- **Major:** Business Administration  
- **Living situation:** Off-campus, commutes daily  
- **Work status:** Part-time job (15 hours/week)  
- **Other relevant info:** Relies on LMS during commuting hours

### Context & Situation  
- **Course load:** 5 courses per semester  
- **LMS usage:** Multiple times weekly for assignments, deadlines, and grades  
- **Access patterns:** Often during commuting hours, especially before deadlines  
- **Relationship to Problem:** Dependent on unreliable system for critical academic functions

### Current solutions they use:  
Submitting early, emailing professors as backup, checking Telegram class groups for updates.

### Pain level:  
High – describes "repeated frustration and wasted time"

## Key Quotes (Verbatim)  
### Quote 1: Submission reliability  
**What they said (verbatim):**  
"Sometimes the LMS just freezes when I try to upload a file, and I never know if it actually went through."

**Context:**  
While describing her process of submitting assignments close to deadlines.

**Why it matters:**  
Shows the lack of trust and reliability in the core system function — file submission.

### Quote 2: Confusing confirmation feedback  
**What they said (verbatim):**  
"It says something like 'File received,' but when I refresh, it's gone. I have to redo the whole thing."

**Context:**  
Came up when asked what happens after submitting a file.

**Why it matters:**  
Highlights unclear feedback design leading to repeated actions and user anxiety.

### Quote 3: Lack of mobile usability  
**What they said (verbatim):**  
"When I open it on my phone, half the buttons don't even work. It's faster to just open my laptop."

**Context:**  
In response to a question about mobile use.

**Why it matters:**  
Indicates poor cross-device usability and accessibility problems.

## Problem Deep Dive  
### The Story: What Happened  
Nino described a recent experience submitting her midterm report. She uploaded the file through the LMS ten minutes before the deadline. The page froze midway and showed an error. She reloaded the site and saw no confirmation. In panic, she emailed the professor directly with the file and a screenshot. Later that day, she found the submission had appeared twice — once incomplete and once final. The professor deducted late penalties because timestamps were unclear.

This isn't an isolated event. She said, "It happens at least once every few weeks," especially when many students are submitting simultaneously. Over time, she developed a routine: upload early, take a screenshot, and double-check via email. She expressed that it "takes extra effort for something that should just work."

Her frustration extends beyond uploads. Notifications for changed deadlines or grades sometimes arrive hours late or not at all. The LMS design feels outdated, and she described it as "slow and cluttered." Despite these issues, she still relies on it daily because professors require it.

### Five Whys / Root Cause Exploration  
**Surface problem:** The LMS fails or lags during critical submission times.

**Why #1:** Why does it fail?  
Their answer: "Probably because everyone's submitting at once. It just can't handle the load."

**Why #2:** Why is that a big problem?  
Their answer: "Because missing a submission deadline means losing points, even if it's the system's fault."

**Why #3:** Why do you feel uncertain about submissions?  
Their answer: "There's no clear message or email confirmation, so I never know if it's saved."

**Why #4:** Why hasn't this been fixed or reported effectively?  
Their answer: "Everyone complains, but the university says 'it's being updated soon,' which never happens."

**Why #5:** Why do students keep using it despite frustration?  
Their answer: "We have no choice. All assignments go through there — we just have to deal with it."

**Root cause assessment:** Students experience high stress and wasted time due to unreliable system performance, unclear feedback, and lack of transparency. Institutional inertia prevents improvements, leading to learned helplessness and parallel workarounds.

## Emotional Impact  
**How did they describe feeling?**  
Stressed, anxious, and annoyed, especially when deadlines approach.

**What words did they use?**  
"Frustrated," "waste of time," "panic," "I don't trust it."

**Physical/behavioural indicators:**  
Sighed repeatedly when describing upload failures; laughed nervously when recalling penalties.

**Impact on her life:**  
Lost time, reduced confidence in technology, and extra mental load from double-checking everything.

## Frequency & Pattern  
**How often does this occur?**  
Weekly; especially during high submission times (Sunday evenings, exam weeks).

**Is there a pattern?**  
Yes — errors spike under heavy traffic and on mobile.

**Has the frequency changed over time?**  
Worsened as more courses adopted the LMS.

**Other instances mentioned:**  
Friends missing grades or losing uploaded files. Some teachers avoid using the LMS for major assignments due to reliability concerns.

## Current Solutions & Workarounds  
### What They Currently Do  
**Primary solution/workaround:** Submitting early and keeping screenshots.

**How they discovered it:** Learned after multiple failed submissions.

**How long they have used it:** Over one year.

### What Works  
- Reduces risk of total failure  
- Provides proof of submission for disputes

### What Does Not Work  
- Adds unnecessary stress and effort  
- Doesn't solve the underlying trust issue

### Tools & Resources Used  
**Tools/apps/systems:**  
- Email: Backup for failed uploads  
- Telegram: Group coordination and deadline reminders  
- Google Drive: Alternative sharing method when LMS crashes

**Other resources:**  
- Screenshots of submission attempts  
- Early submission habit

### Alternatives They Have Tried  
- **Google Classroom:** Used in one course with much smoother experience

**Why current approach is "least bad":** The LMS is mandatory; students rely on early submission and backups rather than system reliability.

## Key Insights & Learnings  
### Surprising Findings  
Students assume system failure as normal and plan around it.

### Contradictions or Tensions  
Students blame the system but continue relying on it daily.

### Patterns Emerging  
Every interviewee so far mentions unclear confirmation and upload anxiety.

### Questions Raised  
- Would automated confirmations rebuild trust?  
- How can the LMS reduce user anxiety during submissions?

## Confidence Level  
☑ Confident

**Why?** Detailed, emotional examples and repeated patterns over time confirm reliability problems are widespread.

## Next Steps & Follow-Up  
### Referrals Provided  
Provided two classmates who experience similar issues.

### Future Contact  
☑ Be contacted for follow-up questions  
☑ Participate in future testing  
☑ Review a prototype  
☑ Join a beta test

**Best way to reach them:** Telegram DM

## Interviewer Notes  
**What went well?** Building rapport early helped the conversation flow naturally. The "Five Whys" questions revealed emotional depth behind technical complaints.

**What could be improved?** Could have probed more into professors' use of LMS tools for grading and communication.

**Follow-up actions:**  
- Interview the two referrals  
- Investigate whether mobile failures align with submission stress

## Post-Interview Reflection  
**Date logged:** 2025-10-23  
**Time to document:** 45 minutes

**One-sentence summary:** Students experience constant stress and wasted time due to unreliable LMS submissions and unclear confirmation messages, leading to distrust and dependence on external tools.
