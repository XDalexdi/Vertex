A: Yes, 21 years old, International Relations.

**Q3: Do you use multiple tools to manage academic deadlines?**  
A: Yes, plus translation tools and home university systems.

### ICP Match Assessment  
Extended match: International student with additional language, cultural, and system barriers.

## Interviewee Background  
### Relevant Demographics  
- **Year:** Third year (exchange student)  
- **Major:** International Relations  
- **Living situation:** International student dormitory  
- **Work status:** No job (visa restrictions)  
- **Other relevant info:** Non-native English speaker

### Context & Situation  
- **Course load:** 5 courses in foreign education system  
- **Group projects:** 2 cross-cultural team projects  
- **Extracurriculars:** International student association  
- **Relationship to Problem:** Daily navigation of language and system barriers

### Current solutions they use:  
LMS, Google Calendar, translation apps, home university portal, physical notebook.

### Pain level:  
Extreme – describes "constant fear of misunderstanding"

## Key Quotes (Verbatim)  
### Quote 1: Language overhead  
**What they said (verbatim):**  
"Everything takes twice as long. I have to translate instructions, double-check my understanding, and constantly worry I'm missing nuances that native speakers catch automatically."

**Context:**  
Describing daily academic workflow challenges.

**Why it matters:**  
Quantifies the additional cognitive load for international students.

### Quote 2: System confusion  
**What they said (verbatim):**  
"In Germany, we have one centralized portal for everything. Here, every professor uses different systems and there's no consistency. As an exchange student, I'm always lost."

**Context:**  
Comparing home and host university systems.

**Why it matters:**  
Highlights system fragmentation compounded by cultural unfamiliarity.

### Quote 3: Visa anxiety  
**What they said (verbatim):**  
"When I miss deadlines, it's not just about grades. My visa depends on maintaining full-time status and good academic standing. One failed course could mean being sent home."

**Context:**  
Explaining consequences of academic failures.

**Why it matters:**  
Reveals high-stakes consequences beyond academic performance.

## Problem Deep Dive  
### The Story: What Happened  
Lena missed a major research paper deadline because the professor announced a format change during a rapid-fire lecture discussion. As a non-native speaker, she didn't catch the specific requirements mentioned casually between main topics. She prepared the paper according to the original syllabus specifications.

When she submitted, the professor deducted 30% for wrong format. The grade drop pushed her below the required GPA for visa compliance. She had to schedule an emergency meeting with the international student office, provide documentation, and petition for special consideration. The process took three weeks of constant anxiety and multiple stressful meetings.

Although ultimately granted an exception, the experience left her with lasting trauma. She now records all lectures (adding 5+ hours weekly for review), triple-checks every assignment detail, and experiences physical anxiety symptoms before every submission.

### Five Whys / Root Cause Exploration  
**Surface problem:** Missed format change leading to grade penalty.

**Why #1:** Why didn't you know about the format change?  
Their answer: "The professor mentioned it quickly in lecture and I didn't understand the importance."

**Why #2:** Why didn't you understand the importance?  
Their answer: "In German universities, important changes are always written in official announcements, not mentioned casually in lectures."

**Why #3:** Why didn't you check with classmates?  
Their answer: "I did, but they said 'don't worry, it's not a big deal' which I now realize meant the opposite here."

**Why #4:** Why the miscommunication?  
Their answer: "Cultural differences in communication styles and my limited English fluency."

**Why #5:** Why wasn't there a safety net?  
Their answer: "The systems here assume cultural and language fluency I don't have."

**Root cause assessment:** International students face compounded challenges of language barriers, cultural differences, and unfamiliar systems without adequate support structures.

## Emotional Impact  
**How did they describe feeling?**  
Terrified, isolated, and constantly "on the verge of academic disaster."

**What words did they use?**  
"Terrified," "isolated," "academic disaster," "constant vigilance."

**Physical/behavioural indicators:**  
Frequently looked around as if checking for threats, spoke in hushed tones about visa concerns.

**Impact on her life:**  
Anxiety symptoms, social isolation, excessive precautionary behaviors.

## Frequency & Pattern  
**How often does this occur?**  
Minor misunderstandings weekly, major incidents 1-2 times per semester.

**Is there a pattern?**  
Always involves combination of language barrier and system unfamiliarity.

**Has the frequency changed over time?**  
Decreased somewhat as she adapted, but anxiety remains high.

**Other instances mentioned:**  
Missed group meeting because time was communicated in 12-hour format she misunderstood.

## Current Solutions & Workarounds  
### What They Currently Do  
**Primary solution/workaround:** Extensive manual systems with redundancy and cross-checking.

**How they discovered it:** Developed through traumatic experiences and trial-and-error.

**How long they have used it:** 4 months with continuous refinement.

### What Works  
- Redundancy catches most errors before they become critical  
- Recording provides safety net for language barriers

### What Does Not Work  
- Extremely time-consuming (10-15 hours weekly overhead)  
- Doesn't prevent all misunderstandings  
- Creates social isolation due to excessive checking behaviors

### Tools & Resources Used  
**Tools/apps/systems:**  
- Lecture recording app: Records all classes for review  
- Google Translate: Real-time translation of materials  
- LMS: Primary course information  
- Google Calendar: Schedule management  
- Physical notebook: Backup system  
- Home university portal: Comparison reference

**Other resources:**  
- International student advisor meetings  
- Language partner program  
- "Mistake log" to track and prevent repeat errors

### Alternatives They Have Tried  
- **Language translation plugins:** Inaccurate for academic content  
- **Note-sharing with native speakers:** Socially awkward to constantly ask  
- **Simplified planning tools:** Don't handle the complexity of her situation

**Why current approach is "least bad":** Provides maximum safety despite unsustainable time cost.

## Key Insights & Learnings  
### Surprising Findings  
International students face visa consequences that make academic failures potentially catastrophic.

### Contradictions or Tensions  
Wants to integrate socially but safety behaviors create isolation.

### Patterns Emerging  
Language and cultural barriers create exponential complexity in academic management.

### Questions Raised  
- How can we design tools that accommodate language and cultural differences?  
- What safety nets are needed for high-stakes academic situations?

## Confidence Level  
☑ Very Confident

**Why?** Clear pattern with high-stakes consequences and detailed workflow understanding.

## Next Steps & Follow-Up  
### Referrals Provided  
Provided two other international student contacts from different countries.

### Future Contact  
☑ Participate in future testing  
☑ Be contacted for follow-up questions  
☐ Review a prototype  
☐ Join a beta test

**Best way to reach them:** WhatsApp or email

## Interviewer Notes  
**What went well?** Good exploration of cultural and language barriers with specific examples.

**What could be improved?** Should have asked about ideal support systems for international students.

**Follow-up actions:**  
- Contact international student referrals  
- Explore language and cultural accommodation features

## Post-Interview Reflection  
**Date logged:** 2025-10-20  
**Time to document:** 60 minutes

**One-sentence summary:** International students face catastrophic visa consequences from academic misunderstandings due to language barriers, cultural differences, and unfamiliar systems, leading to extreme precautionary overhead.
