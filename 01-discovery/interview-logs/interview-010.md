## Key Quotes (Verbatim)

Reveals confusion and inefficiency from fragmented systems.

---

## Problem Deep Dive

### The Story: What Happened
During their marketing strategy project, two members failed to upload deliverables on time because of unclear task ownership. The presentation slides were missing major parts the night before submission. The team had to work overnight to fix the gaps, relying on WhatsApp voice messages and random Notion edits. They barely met the deadline but submitted low-quality work.

The student noted that this pattern happens often — every group project ends with last-minute panic. They tried assigning roles and deadlines in Notion, but no one maintained the system after the first week.

---

### Five Whys / Root Cause Exploration
**Surface problem:** Missed deliverables due to poor task visibility.

**Why #1:** Why wasn’t ownership clear?  
> Because the Notion page didn’t show who was responsible for each task.

**Why #2:** Why wasn’t it updated?  
> Because no one logged in to make changes regularly.

**Why #3:** Why didn’t they log in?  
> Because reminders weren’t integrated into their daily workflow.

**Why #4:** Why weren’t they reminded automatically?  
> Because Notion notifications were turned off and no one used the shared calendar.

**Why #5:** Why didn’t they centralize their workflow?  
> Because each team member preferred a different app (Google Drive, WhatsApp, Notion).

**Root cause assessment:**  
Teams use disconnected tools without shared accountability, causing updates to fall through cracks.

---

## Emotional Impact
**How did they describe feeling?**  
Frustrated, anxious before deadlines, and helpless during coordination breakdowns.

**What words did they use?**  
“Anxious,” “uncoordinated,” “chaotic,” “always last-minute.”

**Physical/behavioural indicators:**  
Tensed posture, laughed nervously when describing all-nighters.

**Impact on life:**  
Reduced sleep, procrastination, loss of confidence in group work.

---

## Frequency & Pattern

Weekly coordination issues, major breakdowns every project cycle.

Always peaks near submission deadlines.

**Has the frequency changed over time?**  
Increasing with more group-heavy coursework.
