## Detailed Cluster Breakdown

### Cluster 1: Tool Fragmentation & Manual Overhead

**Description:**  
Interviewees consistently mentioned frustration with juggling multiple disconnected tools and the extra manual effort required to keep them synchronized.  

**Number of notes:** 8  

**Sample Quotes:**  
1. “I have to check four different apps every morning just to know what I need to do today.” – P001  
2. “I wrote Python scripts to sync my systems, but maintaining them has become another part-time job.” – P004  
3. “Between LMS, Trello, and Calendar, I feel like I’m managing my tools more than my classes.” – P009  

**Interviews represented:** P001–P010

### Cluster 2: High-Stakes Consequences & Anxiety

**Description:**  
Students face significant emotional and physical stress due to academic and administrative pressures, often with high consequences such as visa status or career impact.  

**Number of notes:** 7  

**Sample Quotes:**  
1. “My visa depends on maintaining full-time status. One failed course could mean being sent home.” – P005  
2. “Last month I had to choose between a conference paper that could define my career and grading 80 assignments.” – P004  
3. “The stress caused physical health issues – I developed migraines.” – P003  

**Interviews represented:** P001–P009

### Cluster 3: Trust & Reliability Concerns

**Description:**  
Participants expressed hesitation toward automated or digital systems due to inconsistent performance and unclear feedback.  

**Number of notes:** 5  

**Sample Quotes:**  
1. “I want automation but don’t trust automated systems to be accurate.” – P001  
2. “It’s like gambling — sometimes the upload works, sometimes it doesn’t.” – P008  
3. “There’s no clear message or email confirmation, so I never know if it’s saved.” – P004  

**Interviews represented:** P001–P008

### Cluster 4: Context & Workflow Mismatch

**Description:**  
Interviewees described a mismatch between digital task systems and the real mental or contextual demands of their work.  

**Number of notes:** 4  

**Sample Quotes:**  
1. “My calendar showed the time blocks, but not the mental preparation each task required.” – P004  
2. “Switching from debugging code for a client to writing a research paper leaves me mentally drained.” – P006  
3. “Cultural differences in communication styles and my limited English fluency.” – P005  

**Interviews represented:** P001–P007  

---

### Cluster 5: Social Dynamics & Team Coordination

**Description:**  
Collaboration challenges within teams, especially communication gaps and inconsistent use of shared tools, caused repeated coordination failures.  

**Number of notes:** 5  

**Sample Quotes:**  
1. “When one person’s deadline slips, it creates a domino effect.” – P003  
2. “I built a custom dashboard but my teammates won’t use it.” – P003  
3. “Half of our deadlines get missed because someone didn’t see the message.” – P010  

**Interviews represented:** P003, P010  

---

### Cluster 6: Custom Solutions & Technical Overhead

**Description:**  
Some participants built or maintained their own technical systems to integrate fragmented tools, often creating new maintenance burdens.  

**Number of notes:** 3  

**Sample Quotes:**  
1. “I built a custom dashboard to track everything.” – P003  
2. “I’m basically my own IT department now.” – P004

## Outliers & Uncategorized Insights

**Number of sticky notes that didn’t fit:** 0  
No significant outliers were found; all notes contributed to one of the six clusters.

---

## Process Reflections

### What Surprised Us
Participants’ reliance on self-built scripts and dashboards was more common than expected, even among non-technical users.

### Challenges We Faced
Balancing between similar clusters like *Tool Fragmentation* and *Custom Solutions* was difficult due to overlapping quotes.

### Key Learnings
Tool fragmentation creates hidden time costs and mental strain. Addressing integration and trust could improve productivity and well-being.
