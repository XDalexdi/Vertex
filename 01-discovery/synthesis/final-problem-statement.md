# Final Evidence-Based Problem Statement
 
**Team Name:** Vertex  
**Date:** November 2, 2025  
**Based on:** 10 customer discovery interviews
 
## Executive Summary
 
**One-Sentence Problem Statement:**
University students operating across multiple academic, professional, and personal domains lack intelligent systems that understand their complex cross-context workflows and provide reliable, integrated deadline management, resulting in 2-15 hours of weekly manual overhead, chronic stress from high-stakes consequences, and compromised performance across all domains.
 
**Confidence Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
 
## Complete Problem Statement
 
**University students operating across multiple academic, professional, and personal domains** experience **severe tool fragmentation requiring 2-15 hours weekly of manual synchronization across disconnected systems, leading to missed deadline updates and constant context switching** in **critical academic periods when managing overlapping responsibilities across different platforms during high-stakes deadlines** because **academic and productivity tools are designed for single-domain workflows but students operate across multiple professional contexts simultaneously**, resulting in **2-15 hours weekly manual overhead, chronic 8/10 stress levels from catastrophic consequences, and compromised performance across all domains**.
 
## Problem Statement Components
 
### 1. Specific Segment (WHO)
University students aged 19-26 across undergraduate, graduate, and international programs managing 3+ professional domains simultaneously.
 
### 2. Specific Problem (WHAT)  
Severe tool fragmentation requiring 2-15 hours weekly manual synchronization across 3-5 disconnected systems.
 
### 3. Context (WHEN/WHERE)
During critical academic periods when managing overlapping responsibilities across different platforms.
 
### 4. Root Cause (WHY)
Academic tools designed for single-domain workflows but students operate across multiple professional contexts.
 
### 5. Measurable Consequences (IMPACT)
- 2-15 hours weekly manual overhead
- 8/10 chronic stress levels  
- Academic penalties, professional damage, health impacts
